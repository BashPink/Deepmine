# Deepmine

Deepmine was created as an easy way to run tpruvot's cpuminer-multi (https://github.com/tpruvot/cpuminer-multi). It is essentially an add on not included in cpuminer that allows you to store your wallet address and easily run the miner without having to copy/paste or manually type your address.
